## üåü About This Project

The Chainlit Community repository is a collaborative space for developers to contribute to the broader Chainlit ecosystem. While the [core Chainlit project](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit) focuses on essential features and integrations, this repository serves as a hub for community-maintained extensions, plugins, and integrations.

### Current State

- This repository is separate from the main Chainlit project, allowing for more flexible and community-driven development.
- It hosts a variety of community-contributed extensions and integrations that expand Chainlit's capabilities beyond its core functionality.
- The project is in its early stages, with a growing collection of community contributions.

### Roadmap

1. Establish a clear contribution process and guidelines.
2. Develop and maintain a curated list of community extensions and integrations.
3. Implement a review and testing system for contributed code.
4. Create centralized documentation for all sub-projects in the `docs` folder.
5. Regularly synchronize with the core Chainlit project to ensure compatibility.
6. Foster a vibrant community of contributors and users.

### Project Goals

- Provide a platform for the Chainlit community to extend and enhance the core Chainlit functionality.
- Maintain a high-quality collection of community-driven extensions and integrations.
- Encourage innovation and experimentation within the Chainlit ecosystem.
- Reduce the maintenance burden on the core Chainlit team by distributing responsibility across the community.
- Create a sustainable model for long-term growth and maintenance of the Chainlit ecosystem.
- Foster community collaboration and quality control through shared code reviews, API alignment, and best practices.

### Non-Goals

- Replacing or competing with the core Chainlit project
- Implementing core Chainlit features or functionalities
- Providing official support for Chainlit's core features
- Developing commercial products or services

## üìö Documentation

All documentation for this repository and its sub-projects is centralized in the `docs` folder. This includes setup instructions, usage guides, and API references for each community-maintained feature or integration.

For general Chainlit documentation, please refer to the [official Chainlit documentation](https://docs.chainlit.io).

## üîó Relationship to Core Chainlit

The Chainlit Community repository complements the core Chainlit project by:

- Providing a space for experimental and specialized features.
- Allowing faster iteration and innovation outside the core product cycle.
- Distributing maintenance responsibilities across the community.

The core Chainlit project will continue to focus on:

- Essential features and functionality
- Core LLM framework integrations
- LiteralAI backend integration
- Providing a stable API and hooks for developers to build against

This shared repository structure fosters community collaboration, ensures quality control, and promotes alignment on APIs and best practices.
